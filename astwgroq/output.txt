     >> In C++, an `ReturnStmt` is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node that represents a `return` statement.

In simple terms, a `ReturnStmt` node says: "Hey, I'm done with this function! Give back control to the caller and optionally return a value."

Here's a breakdown:

* `Return` keyword: This is the `return` statement itself.
* `Stmt` suffix: This indicates that it's a statement, not an expression or a declaration.

When a `ReturnStmt` node is executed, the program:

1. Evaluates the expression (if any) associated with the `return` statement.
2. Returns the evaluated value (if any) or `void` if no value is specified.
3. Exits the current function or method.
4. Control is transferred back to the caller (the function or code that called the current function).

Example C++ code:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // ReturnStmt node
}
```
In this example, the `ReturnStmt` node is created when the `return` statement is parsed. When executed, it evaluates the expression `a + b`, returns the result, and exits the `add` function.

     >> In C++, an Abstract Syntax Tree` (AST) is a tree-like data structure that represents the source code in a more structured and organized way. Each node in the tree represents a construct in the source code, such as a variable declaration, a function call, a loop, etc.

Now, let's talk about the `CompoundStmt` node:

**CompoundStmt (Compound Statement)**

A `CompoundStmt` node represents a block of code that contains multiple statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. In other words, it's a group of statements that are executed together.

Here are some examples:
```cpp
if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5";
    x = 10;
}
```
In this example, the `if` statement` is a `CompoundStmt` node, which contains two statements: `cout << "x is greater than 5"` and `x = 10`.

Another example:
```cpp
void myFunction() {
    int x = 5;
    cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```
Here, the `myFunction()` function is a `CompoundStmt` node, which contains two statements: `int x = 5` and `cout << "Hello, World!"`.

In summary, a `CompoundStmt` node represents a block of code that contains multiple statements, enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
  5: 	int a = 19, b = 20;  // DeclStmt
     >> In C++, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node represents a part of the source code. Here's a simple explanation of the `DeclStmt` node:

**DeclStmt (Declaration Statement)**

A `DeclStmt` node represents a statement that declares a variable, function, or other entity. In other words, it's a statement that introduces a new name into the program.

Think of it like this: when you write a variable, like `int x;`, you're declaring a new variable named `x`. The `DeclStmt` node represents this declaration statement.

Here are some examples of code that would generate a `DeclStmt` node:

* `int y;` (declaring a variable `y`)
* `void foo();` (declaring a function `foo`)
* `class MyClass { };` (declaring a class `MyClass`)

In each of these cases, the `DeclStmt` node would contain information about the declaration, such as the name, type, and any other relevant details.

So, in summary, a `DeclStmt` node in the AST represents a statement that declares a new name or entity in the program.
