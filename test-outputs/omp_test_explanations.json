    "description": "This OpenMP directive tells the compiler to execute a loop in parallel across multiple threads. The loop is specified using the 'for' clause, which is not shown in this snippet.",
    "ir_translation": "The directive is lowered into a call to the __kmpc_fork_call function, which is an internal OpenMP runtime function. This function is responsible for creating a new thread and executing the specified loop in parallel.",
    "notes": "The __kmpc_fork_call function takes four arguments: a pointer to the parent thread, an integer indicating the number of threads to create, a pointer to the function to be executed, and a variable number of additional arguments. In this case, the parent thread is represented by the pointer @6, and the function to be executed is the outlined function @_Z3foov.omp_outlined. The outlined function is a wrapper around the original loop that is being parallelized.",
    "ir_snippet": "call void (ptr, i32, ptr, ...) @__kmpc_fork_call(ptr @6, i32 0, ptr @_Z3foov.omp_outlined), !omp.annotation !6\n  ret void"
