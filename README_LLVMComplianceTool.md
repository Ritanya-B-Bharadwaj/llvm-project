# LLVM Pull Request Compliance Checker Tool

This tool automatically reviews LLVM pull requests for compliance with LLVM coding standards. It focuses only on **modified lines** and combines traditional linters with **GenAI-based code suggestions** to assist contributors and maintainers in improving code quality.

## üîç What It Does

- ‚úÖ Checks formatting using `clang-format` (on modified lines only)
- üîç Runs `clang-tidy` on changed files and filters results to modified lines
- üß† Applies custom rules for:

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git installed and configured
- `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` available in PATH
- LLVM repository cloned locally (prebuilt with `clang-tidy` support)
- GitHub personal access token

---

## üìÅ Tool Location

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `llvm-pr-checker.py` script must remain in the **root directory** of the `llvm-project` repository because it relies on relative paths used during LLVM development.

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the tool from the root of your cloned LLVM repository using:

```bash
python llvm-pr-checker.py --repo <llvm_github_repo> --pr <PR_NUMBER> --github-token <GITHUB_TOKEN> --openai-key <OPENAI_KEY>
```
