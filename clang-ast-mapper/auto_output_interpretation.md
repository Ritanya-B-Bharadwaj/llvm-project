# AST Analysis for C++ Code

## Code Summary
This code defines a C++ class with 4 methods/constructors and contains logic for data manipulation and processing.

## Code Structure
The C++ code has been analyzed using Clang's AST system, revealing the following structure:
- **Function Declarations**: The code contains function/method declarations which define its main structure
- **Parameter Variables**: Functions have parameter declarations indicating data passed between functions
- **Code Blocks**: Contains compound statements (blocks of code within curly braces)
- **Return Statements**: Functions include return statements to provide output values
- **Variable Declarations**: The code declares local variables to store and manipulate data
- **Classes/Structs**: The code defines custom data types with methods and fields

## AST Structure Summary
This code follows a typical C++ structure with:

- Class definitions with member methods
- Classes containing member variables (fields)
- Function definitions that contain variable declarations
- Method implementations with local variable usage
- Variable manipulation followed by return statements

## AST Node Types Explained
The following AST nodes were found in the code:

- **DeclStmt** (7 occurrences): Declaration statement - contains one or more variable declarations
- **ReturnStmt** (6 occurrences): Return statement - specifies the value to be returned from a function
- **FunctionDecl** (4 occurrences): Function declaration - defines a function with its return type, name, and parameters
- **CompoundStmt** (3 occurrences): Compound statement - a block of code enclosed in braces {}
- **ParmVarDecl** (3 occurrences): Parameter variable declaration - variables that receive values passed to functions
- **TemplateTypeParmDecl** (2 occurrences): Template type parameter - defines a placeholder type (like T) in a template
- **FunctionTemplateDecl** (2 occurrences): C++ function template declaration - defines a generic function that can work with different types
- **CXXConstructorDecl** (2 occurrences): C++ constructor declaration - special method that initializes objects of a class
- **AccessSpecDecl** (2 occurrences): Access specifier - public, private, or protected sections in a class
- **CXXMethodDecl** (2 occurrences): C++ method declaration - a function that belongs to a class or struct
- **CXXRecordDecl** (1 occurrences): C++ class/struct declaration - defines a user-defined type
- **FieldDecl** (1 occurrences): Field declaration - member variables of a class or struct
