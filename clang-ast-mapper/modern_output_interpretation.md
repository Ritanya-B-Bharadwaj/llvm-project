# AST Analysis for C++ Code

## Code Summary
This code defines a C++ class with 5 methods/constructors and contains logic for data manipulation and processing.

## Code Structure
The C++ code has been analyzed using Clang's AST system, revealing the following structure:
- **Function Declarations**: The code contains function/method declarations which define its main structure
- **Parameter Variables**: Functions have parameter declarations indicating data passed between functions
- **Code Blocks**: Contains compound statements (blocks of code within curly braces)
- **Return Statements**: Functions include return statements to provide output values
- **Variable Declarations**: The code declares local variables to store and manipulate data
- **Control Flow**: Contains conditional or loop structures to control program execution
- **Classes/Structs**: The code defines custom data types with methods and fields

## AST Structure Summary
This code follows a typical C++ structure with:

- Class definitions with member methods
- Classes containing member variables (fields)
- Function definitions that contain variable declarations
- Method implementations with local variable usage
- Variable manipulation followed by return statements
- Control flow structures to manage program execution paths

## AST Node Types Explained
The following AST nodes were found in the code:

- **ReturnStmt** (5 occurrences): Return statement - specifies the value to be returned from a function
- **DeclStmt** (5 occurrences): Declaration statement - contains one or more variable declarations
- **ParmVarDecl** (4 occurrences): Parameter variable declaration - variables that receive values passed to functions
- **BinaryOperator** (4 occurrences): Binary operator - operations that use two operands like +, -, *, /, etc.
