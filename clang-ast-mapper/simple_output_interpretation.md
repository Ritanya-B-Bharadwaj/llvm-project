# AST Analysis for C++ Code

## Code Structure
The C++ code has been analyzed using Clang's AST system, revealing the following structure:
- **Function Declarations**: The code contains function declarations which define its main structure
- **Parameter Variables**: Functions have parameter declarations indicating data passed between functions
- **Code Blocks**: Contains compound statements (blocks of code within curly braces)
- **Return Statements**: Functions include return statements to provide output values
- **Variable Declarations**: The code declares local variables to store and manipulate data

## AST Structure Summary
This code follows a typical C++ structure with:

- Function definitions that contain variable declarations
- Variable manipulation followed by return statements

## AST Node Types Frequency
- **DeclStmt**: 3 occurrences
- **ReturnStmt**: 2 occurrences
- **ParmVarDecl**: 1 occurrences
- **FunctionDecl**: 1 occurrences
- **CompoundStmt**: 1 occurrences

## Code Quality Observations
- The AST structure indicates well-formed C++ code without syntax errors
