    "description": "This OpenMP directive parallelizes a loop, allowing multiple threads to execute the loop iterations concurrently.",
    "ir_translation": "The directive is lowered into a call to the __kmpc_fork_call function, which is responsible for creating a new thread and executing the loop iterations in parallel.",
    "notes": "The __kmpc_fork_call function takes three arguments: the function to be executed in parallel, the number of threads to create, and a variable number of additional arguments. In this case, the function being executed is _Z3foov.omp_outlined, which is the outlined version of the loop. The 0 as the second argument indicates that the number of threads to create is determined by the OpenMP runtime. The ... at the end of the function call indicates that additional arguments may be passed to the function.",
