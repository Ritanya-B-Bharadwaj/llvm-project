        "[OpenMP] Add pre sm_70 load hack back in (#138589)\n\nSummary:\nDifferent ordering modes aren't supported for an atomic load, so we just\ndo an add of zero as the same thing. It's less efficient, but it works.\n\nFixes https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/138560\n\n(cherry picked from commit dfcb8cb2a92c9f72ddde5ea08dadf2f640197d32)"
