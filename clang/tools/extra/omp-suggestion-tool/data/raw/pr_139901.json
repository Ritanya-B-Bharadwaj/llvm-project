    "body": "There were two crashes that have the same root cause: not correctly handling unexpected tokens. In one case, we were failing to return early which caused us to parse a paren as a regular token instead of a special token, causing an assertion. The other case was failing to commit or revert the tentative parse action when not getting a paren when one was expected.\r\n\r\nFixes #139665",
