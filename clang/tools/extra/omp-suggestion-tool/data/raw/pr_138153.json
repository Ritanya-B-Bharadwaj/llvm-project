However, in the lit config this variable was only given a value when the OpenMP runtime build was enabled.\r\n\r\nIf the runtime build was not enabled, %openmp_flags would expand to an empty string, and unless a lit test specifically used -fopenmp in the RUN line, OpenMP would be disabled.\r\n\r\nThis patch sets %openmp_flags to start with \"-fopenmp\" regardless of the build configuration.",
